# BashTools with <3 by gioxmama#5021

## What is it?
BashTools is a small collection of tools that I scripted in Bash to be faster doing some things.

## How is it going to work?
You can choose a Tool that you like and will be possible to look at it, use it and making it better by sending a *PR* will be great.
Any Tool will be well commented and have a readme in the same folder.

# ENJOY
